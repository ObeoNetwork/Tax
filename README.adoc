= Tax Studio

This repository contains the sources of the Tax Studio for https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-web[Sirius Web] 2024.1.2. +
This studio allows the calculation of the price of the customer's cart with the applied VAT (_Value-Added Tax_) according to the jurisdiction of the customer.
The studio offers two activities for the end user: 

* modeling of the different jurisdictions and VATs within them, as well as the customers residing in those and the products subject to the VATs; 
* defining the content of a customer's cart, with computation of the price based on the customer's jurisdiction.

Each activity has its own representation: a diagram representation for the modeling of the jurisdiction and a form representation for defining a customer's cart. +
<<tax_diagram,Figure 1>> illustrates the first activity.

In France there are two tax categories: the alcohol tax with a VAT of 20\% and the food tax with a VAT of 6\%. The Germany has only one tax category: the food tax with a VAT of 7\%. To finish, there are two products: apples (1kg) for 3€, belong to the two food taxes; wine for 12€, belong to the alcohol tax."]
